# Collaborative-ToDo React App Backend

This is the backend of my [Collaborative Todo-Frontend-Repo](https://github.com/yogendra3236/Collaborative-Todo-Frontend) that has been built on ReactJS. <br>
In this Backend part, I have used Axios-API to fetch and send data to the frontend and vice-versa. I have used ExpressJS to do so. I have also used JWT-authentication to verify the user.
<br>
In this App, you can assign Todos to the other person in a certain project, however, for now, the project owner and assignee can view the same projects, in which they both lie, and both can assign Todos to each other.<br>
To store data, I have used MySQL database. You do also need to install it, if you're gonna use this app.

### Requirements and Installation

First, open your terminal, and clone the app, then type, `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies onto your system. <br>
Next, type `npm start` to start your *localhost* server on Port 4000. <br>
You need to start your Frontend server as well, that has been maintained at Port 3000. Now, you're ready to go. <br>

Happy Coding :)
